# Machine Learning for Classification of Astronomical Time Series
Includes the code of experiments for the "Machine Learning for Classification of Astronomical Time Series" essay.

# Selecting the metric
Here I have included the code I used to replicate the experiments from the "Malz, A., et al. (2019)" paper. It includes the simulation of class sizes, the simulation of the mock classifiers. Furthermore, the code used for illustrations is also included.

# Methods for pre-processing the data
The code containing ideas from this section is included in the respository.
